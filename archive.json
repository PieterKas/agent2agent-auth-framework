Credentials here is not a function but an outcome - We could talk about credentialling but then it would collide with the definition is Attestation and Provisioning\n2. Same for identifier: It is an outcome not an action - We could talk about Identification\n3. Attestation and Provisioning are both talking about issuing the credentials - I think it should be only provisioning  that should have this function and definition\n4. Attestation should be before identifier - I attest this workload is of type A therefore I create an identifier an identifier.\n\n\nI propose:\n\n~~~aasvg\n+--------------+----------------------------------+--------------+\n|    Policy    |   Monitoring & Remediation       |  Compliance  |\n|              +----------------------------------+              |\n|              |          Authorization           |              |\n|              +----------------------------------+              |\n|              |          Authentication          |              |\n|              +----------------------------------+              |\n|              |          Credentialling          |              |\n|              +----------------------------------+              |\n|              |          Identification          |              |\n|              +----------------------------------+              |\n|              |           Attestation            |              |\n+--------------+----------------------------------+--------------+\n~~~\n\n> note: there is a typo on compliance\n\n",

It leverages existing standards such as the Workload Identity Management and Secure Exchange (WIMSE) architecture and OAuth 2.0 family of specifications. Rather than defining new protocols, this document describes how existing and widely deployed standards can be applied or extended to establish agent authentication and authorization. By doing so, it aims to provide a framework within which to use existing standards, identify gaps and guide future standardization efforts for agent authentication and authorization.\n```",

It is one of the mechanisms WIMSE defines for authenticating workloads in HTTP-based interactions where transport-layer protections may be insufficient or unavailable. The protocol combines a workload's Workload Identity Token (WIT) (which binds the agent's identity to a public key) with HTTP Message Signatures (using the corresponding private key), thereby providing proof of possession and message integrity for individual HTTP requests and responses. This approach ensures end-to-end authentication and integrity even when traffic traverses intermediaries such as TLS proxies or load balancers that break transport-layer identity continuity. The profile mandates signing of critical request components (e.g., method, target, content digest, and the WIT itself) and supports optional response signing to ensure full protection of workload-to-workload exchanges.\n```",
