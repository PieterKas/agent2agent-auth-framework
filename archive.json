The original diagram is a way to create a mental map for people on how to combine the existing standards as building blocks to create an AIMS system. The above diagram is not helping with this (I am not aware of identification specs, or credentialing specs...). When you build a system you don't build attestation first, you pick how you will identify the components first.\n\nThe original diagram is about creating a mental model for the building blocks needed to create a AI identity management system, and the ordering is about the sequence in which those building blocks get used. You have to decide you identifier format, then you have to decide how he identifier is bound to other attributes (credentials), then you have to decide how you will do identity proofing (attestation), Once you know how you do those things, you have to provision the credentials, now that the workload has. credentials, they can be used for authentication, once you can authenticate, you can authorize, Once you authorize, wou should monitor and remediate the system. There are standards for all of those things and the current diagram is intended to give people an idea on how to combine the existing specs and stack these blocks.\n\nI think what may be needed is more text to explain how to think about this framework as building blocks, as well as a series of design decisions.\n\nYou also gave me another idea.

For each component, we must consider the following 3 phases:\n- Negotiation between the component and its caller on the required pieces of authorization required to interact with the component\n- Acquisition of the piece of authorization by the caller at the authorization server authoritative for the component it wants to communication\n- Validation of the piece of authorization in the context of the request by the component\n\nThose phases rely on the following standards for enforcement of the access control:\n- {{OAUTH-FRAMEWORK}} is an established and maintained framework of specifications for requesting, acquiring, and proving ownership of pieces of authorization in the form of bearer tokens.\n- {{OpenIDConnect.AuthZEN}} is a new specification for exchanging authorization requests and decisions between the layer acting at the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and a Policy Decision Point (PDP).\n- {{OAUTH-TRANS-TOKENS}} is new specification for formatting pieces of authorization in the form of transaction bound bearer tokens.\n\n~~~ ascii-art\n                       +----------------+\n                       | Large Language |\n                       |   Model (LLM)  |\n                       +----------------+\n                              \u25b2   |\n                              \u2502   |               \u250c(H)\u2510\n                              |   \u25bc               \u25bc   \u2502\n+--------------+         +------------+         +-------------+         +-----------+\n|  User /      |\u2500(A)(C)\u2500\u25ba|  AI Agent  |\u2500(E)(H)\u2500\u25ba| Agent /     |\u2500(J)(M)\u2500\u25ba| Services  |\n|      /       |         | (workload) |         |      /      |         |   and     |\n|     / System |\u25c4\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500|            |\u25c4\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500|     / Tools |\u25c4\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500| Resources |\n+--------------+         +------------+         +-------------+         +-----------+\n     \u25b2                       \u25b2  \u25b2                   \u25b2   \u25b2                    \u25b2\n     |    \u250c\u2500\u2500(F)\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518  |                   |   |                    |\n     |    |   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500(D)\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518                  (I)  |                    |\n     |    |   |  +---------------+                  |  (K)                  (N)\n    (B)   |   |  |    Policy     |                  |   |                    |\n     |    |   \u2514\u2500\u25ba|   Decision    |\u25c4\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518   |                    |\n     |    |      |    Point      |\u25c4\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n     |    |      +---------------+                      |\n     |    |             \u25b2                               |\n     |    |          (G)(L)                             |\n     |    |             \u25bc                               |\n     |    |      +---------------+                      |\n     |    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba| Authorization |\u25c4\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba|   server      |\n                 +---------------+\n~~~\n\n\n> Key point - OAuth is broadly supported and provides a delegation model for users to clients (aka Agents). Agents can obtain access tokens directly (client credentials flow, using above authentication methods) or it can be delegated to them by a user (OAuth flows). Make point that the access token includes the client_id, which is the same as the Agent ID (ore related to it) and can be used for authorization decisions, along with other claims in an Access Token (reference JWT Access token spec). Make provision for opaque tokens as well. Discuss Downscoping of Agent authorization using transaction tokens. Discuss cross-domain authorization (use cases) and how it may be achieved (identity chaining and cross-domain authorization). Discuss human in the loop authorization. Note concerns, refer to cross-device BCP as examples of consent phishing attacks. Talk about CIBA as a protocol.\n\n## System to AI Agent\n### (A) Negotiation - OPTIONAL\n\n#### Flow\n\nFollowing {{OAUTH-RESOURCE-METADATA}}, the System MUST act as an OAuth2 client. It MUST interact with the AI Agent on its metadata endpoint which MUST be an OAuth 2.0 protected resource as defined by {{OAUTH-RESOURCE-METADATA}}.\n\nThe System will then understand which Authorization Server MUST be the authority this AI Agent; which scopes or authorization details values MAY be required to access this AI Agent; and if extension mechanisms MAY be required to fulfil.\n\n#### Security\n\nThe System MUST follow the best current practices described in {{OAUTH-BCP}}.\n\n### (B) Initial Authorization\n\nBased on the information collected as part of (A) or based on its configuration, the System MUST initiate an authorization request to the Authorization Server acting as authority for the AI Agent.\n\n#### Flow\n\nFor this, the System MUST use one of the grant types described in {{OAUTH-FRAMEWORK}} as follows:\n\n- In a case of the System is acting on its behalf, it MUST start a client credential grant flow as described in {{Section 1.3.4 of OAUTH-FRAMEWORK}};\n- In the case of the System is acting on behalf of a user:\n  - If the System can interact directly with the user (e.g., browser-based), the System MUST use the authorization code grant flow as described in {{Section 4.1 of OAUTH-FRAMEWORK}};\n  - If the System has limited input capabilities, but the User is present at the device, the System MUST use the Device Authorization Grant {{RFC8628}};\n  - If the User is not present at the consuming device (decoupled flow), the System MUST use Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication {{OpenIDConnect.CIBA}}.\n\n#### Extensions\n\nAs part of the grant flow, the User / System MUST also fulfill all the expected extensions it has an understanding of. For example, not exhaustively:\n- Binding the requested tokens to a possessed key as defined in {{RFC9449}} or {#wpt}\n- Requesting additional authorization details as defined in {{RFC9396}} or {{RFC9126}}\n\n#### Identification\n\nThe System MUST act as an OAuth2 Client which MAY be assigned a WIMSE identifier, which MAY be a SPIFFE ID.\n\nIf so, the System MUST provide a way to resolve one value to the other, either through:\n- A metadata document URL used OAuth2 Client identifier as defined in {{OAUTH-CLIENT-METADATA}};\n- Metadata information provided as part of the Private Key JWT OAuth client credential as defined in {{OAUTH-CLIENTAUTH-JWT}}\n- Public Certificate information provided as part of the mutual TLS OAuth client credential as defined in {{OAuth.mTLS.Auth-RFC8705}}\n\n#### Authentication\n\nThe System MUST authentication using either:\n- Private Key JWT OAuth client authentication as defined in {{OAUTH-CLIENTAUTH-JWT}}\n- Mutual TLS OAuth client authentication as defined in {{OAuth.mTLS.Auth-RFC8705}}\n\n#### Security\n\nThe System MUST follow the best current practices described in {{OAUTH-BCP}} for the interactions with the AI Agent and {{RFC8725}} when handling JWTs.\n\n### (C) Access to the AI Agent\n\n#### Flow\n\nTo access an AI Agent, the System MUST present its authorization credential as defined in {{Section 7 of OAUTH-FRAMEWORK}} as well as defined in {{RFC6750}}. The client MUST be able to process error codes as defined in section 3 of {{RFC6750}}.\n\nThe AI Agent MAY request additional details to be provided through a new authorization credentials using {{OAuth.step-up.Auth-RFC9470}} or error codes as defined in {{RFC6750}}.\n\n#### Security\n\nThe client MUST follow the best current practices described in {{OAUTH-BCP}}.\n\n### (D) Controlling access to the AI Agent\n\n#### Flow\n\nThe AI Agent MUST validate the presented token as described in {{OAUTH-FRAMEWORK}} as well as defined in {{RFC6750}}.\n\nIf token introspection is required, the AI Agent MUST follow {{OAUTH-TOKEN-INTROSPECTION}} as well as {{RFC9701}}.\n\nIf the provided token is a JWT profiled token as defined in {{OAUTH-ACCESSTOKEN-JWT}}, the AI Agent MUST follow the section 2 of this specification as part of the token validation.\n\nIf the AI Agent delegates its access control logic to a Policy decision point, it MUST follow {{OpenIDConnect.AuthZEN}} specification for requesting and receiving a decision for the access.\n\n#### Security\n\nTODO\n\n## AI Agent To Other Agent / Tools\n\nInteractions between an AI Agent and Tools are globally specified by {{MCP}}. Those sections only focus on the Identification, authentication, and authorization aspects of the specification.\n\nInteractions between an AI Agent and other AI Agents are globally specified by {{A2A}}. Note that derived specifications and domain specific specification have emerged like {{AP2}} for Agent payment interaction, {{ACP}} for Agent to commerce flows. Those sections only focus on the Identification, authentication, and authorization aspects of those specifications.\n\n### (E) Negotiation\n\n#### Case of a Tool\nFollowing {{MCP}}, the AI Agent MUST interact with Tools on the metadata endpoint of an OAuth 2.0 protected resource to understand which Authorization Server is the authority this resource; which scopes or authorization details values MAY be required to access this resources; and if proof of possession needs to be presented as standardized with {{RFC9449}}.\n\n#### Case of an Agent\n\nFollowing {{A2A}}, the AI Agent MUST interact with the other Agent through their Agent Card. If Extended Agent Card is implemented, the calling AI Agent MUST collect the information to understand which Authorization Server is the authority this resource; which scopes or authorization details values MAY be required to access this resources; and if proof of possession needs to be presented as standardized with {{RFC9449}}.\n\n{{ACP}} and {{AP2}} Agents are expected to follow the same Agent Card feature as {{A2A}} Agents.\n\n### (F) AI Agent Authorization\n\nBased on the information collected as part of (E), the AI Agent is initiating an authorization request with the Authorization Server acting as authority for the AI Tools.\n\nSuch authorization request can allow to down, change or translate scope; enrich the authorization with new details based on the context; extend the time boundaries of the authorization; or change from a delegation mode to an impersonation mode and reversely.\n\n- If the AI Agent acts on its behalf as a system:\n  - If it does not want or need to refer to the previous context, it MUST start a client credential grant flow as described in {{Section 1.3.4 of OAUTH-FRAMEWORK}};\n  - If it does want or need to refer to the previous context, it MUST start a token exchange flow as described in {{OAUTH-TOKEN-EXCHANGE}}. The AI Agent will be able to decide in between obtaining tokens representing a Delegation or an Impersonation as described in section 1.1 of the specification.\n- If the AI Agent acts on delegation by a user:\n  - If the AI Agent can interact and want to interact with the user through the client, it MUST start an authorization code grant flow as described in {{Section 1.3.1 of OAUTH-FRAMEWORK}};\n  - If the AI Agent cannot or does not want to interact with the user through the client, it MAY:\n    - Start a token exchange flow as described in {{OAUTH-TOKEN-EXCHANGE}}.

It leverages existing standards such as the Workload Identity Management and Secure Exchange (WIMSE) architecture and OAuth 2.0 family of specifications. Rather than defining new protocols, this document describes how existing and widely deployed standards can be applied or extended to establish agent authentication and authorization. By doing so, it aims to provide a framework within which to use existing standards, identify gaps and guide future standardization efforts for agent authentication and authorization.\n```",

It is one of the mechanisms WIMSE defines for authenticating workloads in HTTP-based interactions where transport-layer protections may be insufficient or unavailable. The protocol combines a workload's Workload Identity Token (WIT) (which binds the agent's identity to a public key) with HTTP Message Signatures (using the corresponding private key), thereby providing proof of possession and message integrity for individual HTTP requests and responses. This approach ensures end-to-end authentication and integrity even when traffic traverses intermediaries such as TLS proxies or load balancers that break transport-layer identity continuity. The profile mandates signing of critical request components (e.g., method, target, content digest, and the WIT itself) and supports optional response signing to ensure full protection of workload-to-workload exchanges.\n```",
