            Agent-to-Agent Authentication and Authorization
      draft-agent2agent-kasselman_lombardo-agent2agent-auth-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a framework for secure agent-to-agent (A2A)
   interactions leveraging existing standards such as OAuth 2.0 and the
   Workload Identity Management and Secure Exchange (WIMSE)
   architecture.  Rather than defining new protocols, this document
   explores how existing and widely deployed stnadards can be applied or
   extended to establish agent-to-agent authentication and
   authorization.  By doing so, it aims to provide a framewrok within
   which to identify use of existing standards and identify gaps and
   guide future standardization efforts for secure agent-to-agent
   authentication and authorization.

3.  Agents are workloads

   An Agent is a workload that iteratively interacts with a Large
   Language Model (LLM) and a set of tools that expose interfaces to
   underlying services and resources until a terminating condition,
   determined either by the LLM or by the agent’s internal logic, is
   reached.  It may receive input from a user, or act autonomusly.
   Figure 1 shows a conceptual model of the AI Agent as a workload.

   Figure 1 illustrates the high-level interaction model between the
   User, the AI Agent, the Large Language Model (LLM), the Tools invoked
   by the Agent, and the underlying Services and Resources accessed
   through those Tools.

                  +----------------+
                  | Large Language |
                  |   Model (LLM)  |

   |        |--(8)->|            |<-(7)--|        |<-(6)--| Resources |
   +--------+       +------------+       +--------+       +-----------+

                      Figure 1: AI Agent as a Workload

   1.  Optional: The User provides an initial request or instruction to
       the AI Agent.

   2.  The AI Agent forwards the available context to the LLM.  Context
       isimplementation and deployment specific and may include User
       input, system prompt, tool descriptions, tool outputs and other
       relevant information.

   3.  The LLM returns a response to the AI Agent identifying which
       tools it should invoke.

   4.  Based on the LLM’s output, the AI Agent invokes the relevant
       Tools.

   5.  The Tools interacts with the underlying Services and Resources
       required to fulfill the requested operation.

   6.  The underlying Services and Resources returns the information
       requested by the Tools.

   7.  The Tools returns the information collected from the Services and
       Resources to the AI Agent, which sends the information as
       additional context to the Large Langugage Model, repeating steps
       2-7 until the exit condition is reached and the task is
       completed.

   8.  Optional: Once the exit condition is reached in step 7, the AI
       Agent may return a response to the User.

   As shown in Figure 1, the AI Agent is a workload that needs and
   identifier and credentials with which to authenticate itself to the
   Large Langugage Model and Tools.  Once it has authenticated, the
   Large Langugage Model and Tools must determine if the AI Agent is
   authorized to access it.  If the AI Agent is acting on-behalf-of a
   User, the User needs to deelegate access to the AI Agent, and the
   context of the User needs to be preserved to inform authorization
   decisions.

   This document describes how AI Agents should leverage existing
   standards defined by SPIFFE [SPIFFE], WIMSE, OAuth and SSF.

4.  Agent Identity Management System

   An Agent Identity Management System ensure that the right Agent has
   access to the right resources and tools at the right time for the
   right reason.  It consists out of the following components:

   *  *Agent Identifiers:* Unique identifier assigned to every Agent.

   *  *Agent Credentials:* Cryptographic binding between the Agent
      Identifier and attributes of the Agent.

   *  *Agent Attestation:* Mechanisms for determining and assigning the
      identifier and issue credentials based on measurements of the
      Agent's environment.

   *  *Agent Credential Provisioning:* The mechanism for provisioning
      credentials to the agent at runtime.

   *  *Agent Authentication:* Protocols and mechanisms used by the Agent
      to authenticate itself to Large Langugage Models or Tools
      (resource or server) in the system.

   *  *Agent Authorization:* Protocols and systems used to determine if
      an Agent is allowed to access a Large Langugage Model or Tool
      (resource or server).

   *  *Agent Monitoring and Remediation:* Protocols and mechanisms to
      dynamically modify the authorization decisions based on observed
      behaviour and system state.

   *  *Agent Auhtentication and Authorization Policy:* The configuration
      and rules for each of the Agent Identity Management System.

   *  *Agent Compliance:* Measurement of the state and fucntioning of
      the system against the stated policies.

5.  Agent Identifier

   Agents MUST be uniquely identified to enable authentication and
   authorization.  The Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone
   (SPIFFE) identifier format is widely deployed and operationally
   mature.  The SPIFFE workload identity model defines a SPIFFE
   identifier (SPIFFE ID) as a URI of the form spiffe://<trust-
   domain>/<path> that uniquely identifies a workload within a trust
   domain [SPIFFE].

   The Workload Identity in Multi-System Environments (WIMSE) working
   group builds on the experiences gained by the SPIFFE community and
   defines the WIMSE workload identifier [WIMSE_ID] as a URI that
   uniquely identifies a workload within a given trust domain.

   Because SPIFFE IDs are URI-based workload identifiers and their
   structure aligns with the identifier model defined in the WIMSE
   identifier draft, all SPIFFE IDs can be treated as valid WIMSE
   identifiers.

   All Agents MUST be assigned a WIMSE identifier, which MAY be a SPIFFE
   ID.

6.  Agent Credentials

   Agents MUST have credentials that provide a cryptographic binding to
   the agent identifier.  These credentials are considered primary
   credentials that are provisioned at runtime.  The cryptographic
   binding is essential for establishing trust since an identifier on
   its own is insufficient unless it is verifiably tied to a key or
   token controlled by the agent.  WIMSE define a profile of X.509
   certificates and Workload Identity Tokens (WITs), while SPIFFE
   defines SPIFFE Verified ID (SVID) profiles of JSON Web Token (JWT-
   SVID), X.509 certificates (X.509-SVID) and WIMSE Workload Identity
   Tokens (WIT-SVID).  SPIFFE SVID credentials are compatible with WIMSE
   defined credentials.  The choice of an appropriate format depends on
   the trust model and integration requirements.

   Agent credentials MUST be ephemeral, include an explicit expiration
   time, and MAY carry additional attributes relevant to the agent
   (e.g., trust domain, attestation evidence, or workload metadata).

   In some cases, agents MAY need to have access to a secondary
   credential format to acces a proprietary or legacy system that is not
   compatible with the X.509, JWT or WIT it is provisioned with.  In
   these cases an agent MAY exchange their primary credentials through a
   credential exchange mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange,
   Transaction Tokens, Workload Identity Federation).  This allows an
   agent to obtain a credential targeted to a specific relying party by
   leveraging the primary credential in its possession.

   Note: Static API keys are an anti-pattern for agent identity.  They
   lack cryptographic binding, cannot convey attestation or provenance,
   and are difficult to rotate or scope, making them unsuitable for
   secure Agent-to-Agent authentication or authorization.

7.  Agent Attestation

   Agent attestation is the identity-proofing mechanism for AI agents.
   Just as humans rely on identity proofing during account creation or
   credential issuance, agents require a means to demonstrate what they
   are, how they were instantiated, and under what conditions they are
   operating.  Attestation evidence feeds into the credential issuance
   process and determines whether a credential is issued, the type of
   credential issued and the contents of the credential.

   Multiple attestation mechanisms exist, and the appropriate choice is
   deployment, and risk, specific.  These mechanisms may include
   hardware-based attestations (e.g., TEE evidence), software integrity
   measurements, supply-chain provenance, platform and orchestration-
   layer attestations, or operator assertions.  Depending on the risk
   involved, a single attestation may be sufficient, or, in higher risk
   scenarios, multi-attestation may be requred.

   The Remote ATtestation Procedures (RATS) architecture (see [RFC9334])
   provides a general model for producing, conveying, and verifying
   attestation evidence.  RATS defines the roles of Attester, Verifier,
   and Relying Party, as well as the concept of Evidence, Endorsements,
   and Attestation Results.

   Workload identity management systems can use different attestation
   mechanisms and implementations (including RATS), to represent
   attestation evidence and deliver it to credential provisioning
   systems.

8.  Agent Credential Provisioning

   Agent credential provisioning refers to the runtime issuance,
   renewal, and rotation of the credentials an agent uses to
   authenticate and authorize itself to other agents.  Agents may be
   provisioned with one or more credential types as described in
   Section 6.  Unlike static secrets, agent credentials are provisioned
   dynamically and are intentionally short-lived, eliminating the
   operational burden of manual expiration management and reducing the
   impact of credential compromise.  Agent credential provisioning must
   operate autonomously, scale to high-churn environments, and integrate
   closely with the attestation mechanisms that establish trust in the
   agent at each issuance or rotation event.

   Agent credential provisioning typically includes two phases:

   1.  *Initial Provisioning*: The process by which an agent first
       acquires a credential bound to its identity.  This often occurs
       immediately after deployment or instantiation and is based on
       verified properties of the agent (e.g., deployment context,
       attestation evidence, or orchestration metadata).

   2.  *Rotation/Renewal*: The automatic refresh of short-lived
       credentials before expiration.  Continuous rotation ensures that
       credentials remain valid only for the minimum necessary time and
       that authorization state reflects current operational conditions.

   The use of short-lived credentials provides a signiifcant improvement
   in the risk profile and risk of credential exposure.  It provides an
   alternative to explicit revocation mechanisms and simplifies
   lifecycle management in large, automated environments.

   Deployed frameworks such as [SPIFFE] provide concrete mechanisms for
   automated, short-lived credential provisioning at runtime based on
   workload attestation.  In addition to issuing short-lived
   credentials, [SPIFFE] also provisions ephemeral cryptographic key
   material bound to each credential, further reducing the risks
   associated with compromising long-lived keys.

9.  Agent Authentication - Pieter

   Key point - agents may authenticate in a number of ways based on
   credentials, supported protocols and environment.  Distinguish
   between network and application layer.  Refernece WIMSE.

9.1.  Network layer authentication

   MTLS

9.2.  Application layer authentication

   WPT, HTTP Sig.

10.  Agent Authorization - Jeff

   Key point - OAuth is broadly supported and provides a delegation
   model for users to clients (aka agents).  Agents can obtain acess
   tokens directly (client credentials flow, using above authentication
   methods) or it can be delegated to them by a user (OAuth flows).
   Make point that the access token includes the client_id, which is the
   same as the Agent ID (ore related to it) and can be used for
   authroization decisions, along with other claims in an Access Token
   (reference JWT Access token spec).  Make provision for opaque tokens
   as well.  Discuss Downscoping of agent authorization using
   transaction tokens.  Discuss cross-domain authorization (use cases)
   and how it may be achieved (identity chaining and cross-domain
   authorization).  Discuss human in the loop authroization.  Note
   concerns, refer to cross-device BCP as examples of consent phishing
   attacsk.  Talk about CIBA as a protocol.

   Picture -> Access Token -> Transaction Token -> Domain 1 -> Domain 2

10.1.  Same Domain Authorization

10.1.1.  Initial Authorization

   User Delegated Authroization Initial authorization - user or agent
   gets access token.

10.1.2.  Donwscoped, Time Bount, Context Enriched Agent Authorization

   Transaction Tokens

10.1.3.  Agent-to-Resource Authorization

   Present token, peform additional authorization (RBAC etc?)  Direct or
   via tools Resources, services.

   Agent -> Tool -> Service -> Resource

10.1.4.  Human-in-the loop

   Agent framework problem -> human in the loop - confirm something that
   it can already do - agent framework capability - confirmation.  Risk
   management flow.  Human in the loop - request esalated privelages.
   Step-up authorization - refernece the draft (maybe)

   MCP Elicitation to agent to perform some browser things - start authz
   code grant flow.  CIBA

10.2.  Cross Domain Agent-to-Agent Authorization

   Identiyt chaining, ID-Jag.

11.  Agent Monitoring and Remediation - Jeff

   Key point - ongoing monitoring and remediation is needed.  Use
   protocols like SSE, CAEP to respond to changes in authorization.
   Note the need for ongoing logging and audit trails.  Talk about end-
   to-end audit and how this is enabled by having agent identifiers.

12.  Agent Auhtentication and Authorization Policy - Discuss

   Key point - configuration and parameters for all the above
   constitutes policy.  Not stnadardises and not recommended for
   standrdisation?  Perhaps somethign about document format?

13.  Agent Compliance - Discuss

   Key point - audit against Agent Identity Policy - not standrdised and
   not recommended to standardise.  Governance and observability.
   Perhaps we discuss and describe, but don't suggest standards here.
