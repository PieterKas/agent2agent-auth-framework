               AI Agent Authentication and Authorization
                     draft-klr-aiagent-auth-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a framework for authentication and
   authorization of AI agent interactions.  It leverages existing
   standards such as the Workload Identity Management and Secure
   Exchange (WIMSE) architecture and OAuth 2.0 family of specifications.
   Rather than defining new protocols, this document describes how
   existing and widely deployed standards can be applied or extended to
   establish agent authentication and authorization.  By doing so, it
   aims to provide a framework within which to use existing standards,
   identify gaps and guide future standardization efforts for agent
   authentication and authorization.

3.  Agents are workloads

   An Agent is a workload that iteratively interacts with a Large
   Language Model (LLM) and a set of Tools, Services and Resources.  An
   agent performs its operations until a terminating condition,
   determined either by the LLM or by the agent's internal logic, is
   reached.  It may receive input from a user, or act autonomously.
   Figure 1 shows a conceptual model of the AI Agent as a workload and
   illustrates the high-level interaction model between the User or
   System, the AI Agent, the Large Language Model (LLM), Tools,
   Services, and Resources.

   In this document, Tools, Services, and Resources are treated as a
   single category of external endpoints that an agent invokes or
   interacts with to complete a task.  Communication within or between
   Tools, Services, and Resources is out of scope.

                   +----------------+
                   | Large Language |
                   |   Model (LLM)  |

   1.  Optional: The User or System (e.g. a batch job or another Agent)
       provides an initial request or instruction to the AI Agent.

   2.  The AI Agent provides the available context to the LLM.  Context
       is implementation- and deployment-specific and may include User
       or System input, system prompts, Tool descriptions, prior Tool,
       Service and Resource outputs, and other relevant state.

   3.  The LLM returns output to the AI Agent facilitating selection of
       Tools, Services or Resources to invoke.

   4.  The AI Agent invokes one or more external endpoints of selected
       Tools, Services or Resources.  A Tool endpoint may itself be
       implemented by another AI agent.

   5.  The external endpoint of the Tools, Services or Resources returns
       a result of the operation to the AI Agent, which may sends the
       information as additional context to the Large Language Model,
       repeating steps 2-5 until the exit condition is reached and the
       task is completed.

   6.  Optional: Once the exit condition is reached in step 5, the AI
       Agent may return a response to the User or System.  The AI Agent
       may also return intermediate results or request additional input.

   As shown in Figure 1, the AI Agent is a workload that needs an
   identifier and credentials with which it can be authenticated by the
   User or System, Large Language Model and Tools/Services/Resources.
   Once authenticated, these parties must determine if the AI Agent is
   authorized to access the requested Large Language Model, Tools,
   Services or Resources.  If the AI Agent is acting on behalf of a User
   or System, the User or System needs to delegate authority to the AI
   Agent, and the User or System context MUST be preserved to as input
   to authorization decisions and recorded in audit trails.

   This document describes how AI Agents should leverage existing
   standards defined by SPIFFE [SPIFFE], WIMSE, OAuth and OpenID SSF
   [SSF].

4.  Agent Identity Management System

   This document defines the term Agent Identity Management System
   (AIMS) as a conceptual model describing the set of functions required
   to establish, maintain, and evaluate the identity and permissions of
   an agent workload.  AIMS does not refer to a single product,
   protocol, or deployment architecture.  AIMS may be implemented by one
   component or distributed across multiple systems (such as identity
   providers, attestation services, authorization servers, policy
   engines, and runtime enforcement points).

   An Agent Identity Management System ensures that the right Agent has
   access to the right resources and tools at the right time for the
   right reason.  An Agent identity management system depends on the
   following components to achieve its goals:

   *  *Agent Identifiers:* Unique identifier assigned to every Agent.

   *  *Agent Credentials:* Cryptographic binding between the Agent
      Identifier and attributes of the Agent.

   *  *Agent Attestation:* Mechanisms for determining and assigning the
      identifier and issue credentials based on measurements of the
      Agent's environment.

   *  *Agent Credential Provisioning:* The mechanism for provisioning
      credentials to the agent at runtime.

   *  *Agent Authentication:* Protocols and mechanisms used by the Agent
      to authenticate itself to Large Langugage Models or Tools
      (resource or server) in the system.

   *  *Agent Authorization:* Protocols and systems used to determine if
      an Agent is allowed to access a Large Langugage Model or Tool
      (resource or server).

   *  *Agent Monitoring and Remediation:* Protocols and mechanisms to
      dynamically modify the authorization decisions based on observed
      behaviour and system state.

   *  *Agent Auhtentication and Authorization Policy:* The configuration
      and rules for each of the Agent Identity Management System.

   *  *Agent Compliance:* Measurement of the state and fucntioning of
      the system against the stated policies.

   The components form a logical stack in which higher layers depend on
   guarantees provided by lower layers, as illustrated in Figure 2.

5.  Agent Identifier

   Agents MUST be uniquely identified in order to support
   authentication, authorization, auditing, and delegation.

   The Workload Identity in Multi-System Environments (WIMSE) identifier
   as defined by [WIMSE-ID] is the primary identifier for agents in this
   framework.

   A WIMSE identifier is a URI that uniquely identifies a workload
   within a trust domain.  Authorization decisions, delegation
   semantics, and audit records rely on this identifier remaining stable
   for the lifetime of the workload identity.

   The Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone ([SPIFFE])
   identifier is a widely deployed and operationally mature
   implementation of the WIMSE identifier model.  A SPIFFE identifier
   ([SPIFFE-ID]) is a URI in the form of spiffe://<trust-domain>/<path>
   that uniquely identifies a workload within a trust domain.

   An agent participating in this framework MUST be assigned exactly one
   WIMSE identifier, which MAY be a SPIFFE ID.

6.  Agent Credentials

   Agents MUST possess credentials that provide a cryptographic binding
   to the agent identifier.  These credentials are considered primary
   credentials that are provisioned at runtime.  An identifier alone is
   insufficient unless it can be verified to be controlled by the
   communicating agent through a cryptographic binding.

   WIMSE credentials ([WIMSE-CRED]) are defined as a profile of X.509
   certificates and Workload Identity Tokens (WITs), while SPIFFE
   defines SPIFFE Verified ID (SVID) profiles of JSON Web Token (JWT-
   SVID), X.509 certificates (X.509-SVID) and WIMSE Workload Identity
   Tokens (WIT-SVID).  SPIFFE SVID credentials are compatible with WIMSE
   defined credentials.  The choice of an appropriate format depends on
   the trust model and integration requirements.

   Agent credentials SHOULD be short-lived to minimize the risk of
   credential theft, MUST include an explicit expiration time after
   which it is no longer accepted, and MAY carry additional attributes
   relevant to the agent (for example trust domain, attestation
   evidence, or workload metadata).

   Deployments can improve the assurance of agent identity by protecting
   private keys using hardware-backed or isolated cryptographic storage
   such as TPMs, secure enclaves, or platform security modules when such
   capabilities are available.  These mechanisms reduce key exfiltration
   risk but are not required for interoperability.

   In some cases, agents MAY need a secondary credentials to access a
   proprietary or legacy system that is not compatible with the X.509,
   JWT or WIT it is provisioned with.  In these cases an agent MAY
   exchange their primary credentials through a credential exchange
   mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [OAUTH-TOKEN-EXCHANGE],
   Transaction Tokens [OAUTH-TRANS-TOKENS] or Workload Identity
   Federation).  This allows an agent to obtain a credential targeted to
   a specific relying party by leveraging the primary credential in its
   possession.

   *Note*: Static API keys are an anti-pattern for agent identity.  They
   are bearer artefacts that are not cryptographically bound, do not
   convey identity, are typically long-lived and are operationally
   difficult to rotate, making them unsuitable for secure agent
   authentication or authorization.

7.  Agent Attestation

   Agent attestation is the identity-proofing mechanism for AI agents.
   Just as humans rely on identity proofing during account creation or
   credential issuance, agents require a means to demonstrate what they
   are, how they were instantiated, and under what conditions they are
   operating.  Attestation evidence feeds into the credential issuance
   process and determines whether a credential is issued, the type of
   credential issued and the contents of the credential.

   Multiple attestation mechanisms exist, and the appropriate choice is
   deployment and risk specific.  These mechanisms may include hardware-
   based attestations (e.g., TEE evidence), software integrity
   measurements, supply-chain provenance, platform and orchestration-
   layer attestations, or operator assertions to name a few.  Depending
   on the risk involved, a single attestation may be sufficient, or, in
   higher risk scenarios, multi-attestation may be requred.

   There are numerous systems that perform some kind of attestation, any
   of which can be used in establishing agent identity.  One example of
   such a system is the Remote ATtestation Procedures (RATS)
   architecture ([RATS-ARCH]), which provides a general model for
   producing, conveying, and verifying attestation evidence and defines
   the roles of Attester, Verifier, and Relying Party, as well as the
   concept of Evidence, Endorsements, and Attestation Results.

   An agent identity management system may incorporate different
   attestation mechanisms and implementations (including RATS) to
   collect attestation evidence and provide it to credential
   provisioning components.  The selection of mechanisms depends on the
   deployment constraints and the desired level of trust assurance.

8.  Agent Credential Provisioning

   Agent credential provisioning refers to the runtime issuance,
   renewal, and rotation of the credentials an agent uses to
   authenticate and authorize itself to other agents.  Agents may be
   provisioned with one or more credential types as described in
   Section 6.  Unlike static secrets, agent credentials are provisioned
   dynamically and are intentionally short-lived, eliminating the
   operational burden of manual expiration management and reducing the
   impact of credential compromise.  Agent credential provisioning must
   operate autonomously, scale to high-churn environments, and integrate
   closely with the attestation mechanisms that establish trust in the
   agent at each issuance or rotation event.

   Agent credential provisioning typically includes two phases:

   1.  *Initial Provisioning*: The process by which an agent first
       acquires a credential bound to its identity.  This often occurs
       immediately after deployment or instantiation and is based on
       verified properties of the agent (e.g., deployment context,
       attestation evidence, or orchestration metadata).

   2.  *Rotation/Renewal*: The automatic refresh of short-lived
       credentials before expiration.  Continuous rotation ensures that
       credentials remain valid only for the minimum necessary time and
       that authorization state reflects current operational conditions.

   The use of short-lived credentials provides a signiifcant improvement
   in the risk profile and risk of credential exposure.  It provides an
   alternative to explicit revocation mechanisms and simplifies
   lifecycle management in large, automated environments while removing
   the risks of downtime as a result of credential expiry.

   Deployed frameworks such as [SPIFFE] provide proven mechanisms for
   automated, short-lived credential provisioning at runtime.  In
   addition to issuing short-lived credentials, [SPIFFE] also provisions
   ephemeral cryptographic key material bound to each credential,
   further reducing the risks associated with compromising long-lived
   keys.

9.  Agent Authentication

   Agents may authenticate using a variety of mechanisms, depending on
   the credentials they possess, the protocols supported in the
   deployment environment, and the risk profile of the application.  As
   described in the WIMSE Architecture [WIMSE-ARCH], authentication can
   occur at either the transport layer or the application layer, and
   many deployments rely on a combination of both.

9.1.  Transport layer authentication

   Transport-layer authentication establishes trust during the
   establishment of a secure transport channel.  The most common
   mechanism used by agents is mutually-authenticated TLS (mTLS), in
   which both endpoints present X.509-based credentials and perform a
   bidirectional certificate exchange as part of the TLS negotiation.
   When paired with short-lived workload identities, such as those
   issued by SPIFFE or WIMSE, mTLS provides strong channel binding and
   cryptographic proof of control over the agent’s private key.

   mTLS is particularly well-suited for environments where transport-
   level protection, peer authentication, and ephemeral workload
   identity are jointly required.  It also simplifies authorization
   decisions by enabling agents to associate application-layer requests
   with an authenticated transport identity.  One example of this is the
   use of mTLS in service mesh architecctures such as Istio or LinkerD.

9.1.1.  Limitations

   There are scenarios where transport-layer authentication is not
   desirable or cannot be relied upon.  In architectures involving
   intermediaries, such as proxies, API gateways, service meshes, load
   balancers, or protocol translators, TLS sessions are often terminated
   and re-established, breaking the end-to-end continuity of transport-
   layer identity.  Similarly, some deployment models (such as
   serverless platforms, multi-tenant edge environments, or cross-domain
   topologies) may obscure or abstract identity presented at the
   transport layer, making it difficult for relying parties to bind
   application-layer actions to a credential presented at the transport-
   layer.  In these cases, application-layer authentication provides a
   more robust and portable mechanism for expressing agent identity and
   conveying attestation or policy-relevant attributes.

9.2.  Application layer authentication

   Application-layer authentication allows agents to authenticate
   independently of the underlying transport.  This enables end-to-end
   identity preservation even when requests traverse proxies, load
   balancers, or protocol translation layers.

   The WIMSE working group defines WIMSE Proof Tokens and HTTP Message
   Signatures as authentication mechanisms that may be used by agents.

9.2.1.  WIMSE Proof Tokens (WPTs)

   WIMSE Workload Proof Tokens (WPTs, [WIMSE-WPT]) are a protocol-
   independent, application-layer mechanism for proving possession of
   the private key associated with a Workload Identity Token (WIT).
   WPTs are generated by the agent, using the private key matching the
   public key in the WIT.  A WPT is defined as a signed JSON Web Token
   (JWT) that binds an agent’s authentication to a specific message
   context, for example, an HTTP request, thereby providing proof of
   possession rather than relying on bearer semantics.

   WPTs are designed to work alongside WITs [WIMSE-CRED] and are
   typically short-lived to reduce the window for replay attacks.  They
   carry claims such as audience (aud), expiration (exp), a unique token
   identifier (jti), and a hash of the associated WIT (wth).  A WPT may
   also include hashes of other related tokens (e.g., OAuth access
   tokens) to bind the authentication contexts to specific transaction
   or authorizations details.

   Although the draft currently defines a protocol binding for HTTP (via
   a Workload-Proof-Token header), the core format is protocol-agnostic,
   making it applicable to other protocols.  Its JWT structure and
   claims model allow WPTs to be bound to different protocols and
   transports, including asynchronous or non-HTTP messaging systems such
   as Kafka and gRPC, or other future protocol bindings.  This design
   enables relying parties to verify identity, key possession, and
   message binding at the application layer even in environments where
   transport-layer identity (e.g., mutual TLS) is insufficient or
   unavailable.

9.2.2.  HTTP Message Signatures

   The WIMSE Workload-to-Workload Authentication with HTTP Signatures
   specification [WIMSE-HTTPSIG] defines an application-layer
   authentication profile built on the HTTP Message Signatures standard
   [HTTP-SIG].  It is one of the mechanisms WIMSE defines for
   authenticating workloads in HTTP-based interactions where transport-
   layer protections may be insufficient or unavailable.  The protocol
   combines a workload's Workload Identity Token (WIT) (which binds the
   agent's identity to a public key) with HTTP Message Signatures (using
   the corresponding private key), thereby providing proof of possession
   and message integrity for individual HTTP requests and responses.
   This approach ensures end-to-end authentication and integrity even
   when traffic traverses intermediaries such as TLS proxies or load
   balancers that break transport-layer identity continuity.  The
   profile mandates signing of critical request components (e.g.,
   method, target, content digest, and the WIT itself) and supports
   optional response signing to ensure full protection of workload-to-
   workload exchanges.

9.2.3.  Limitations

   Unlike transport-layer authentication, application-layer
   authentication does not inherently provide channel binding to the
   underlying secure transport.  As a result, implementations MUST
   consider the risk of message relay or replay if tokens or signed
   messages are accepted outside their intended context.  Deployments
   typically mitigate these risks through short token lifetimes,
   audience restrictions, nonce or unique identifier checks, and binding
   authentication to specific requests or transaction parameters.

10.  Agent Authorization

   Agents act on behalf of a user, a system, or on their own behalf as
   shown in Figure 1 and needs to obtain authorization when interacting
   with protected resources.

10.1.  Leverage OAuth 2.0 as a Delegation Authorization Framework

   The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [OAUTH-FRAMEWORK] is widely
   deployed and defines an authorization delegation framework that
   enables an Agent to obtain limited access to a protected resource
   (e.g. a service or API) under well-defined policy constraints.  An
   Agent MUST use OAuth 2.0-based mechanisms to obtain authorization
   from a user, a system, or on its own behalf.  OAuth 2.0 defines a
   wide range of authorization grant flows that supports these
   scenarios.  In these Oauth 2.0 flows, an Agent acts as an OAuth 2.0
   Client to an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, which receives the
   request, evaluate the authorization policy and returns an access
   token, which the Agent presents to the Resource Server (i.e. the
   protected resources such as the LLM or Tools in Figure 1) it needs to
   access to complete the request.

10.2.  Use of OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens

   An OAuth access token represents the authorization granted to the
   Agent.  In many deployments, access tokens are structured as JSON Web
   Tokens (JWTs) [OAUTH-ACCESSTOKEN-JWT], which include claims such as
   'client_id', 'sub', 'aud', 'scope', and other attributes relevant to
   authorization.  The access token MUST include the Agent identity as
   the 'client_id' claim as defined in Section 2.2 of
   [OAUTH-ACCESSTOKEN-JWT].

   If the Agent is acting on-behalf of another user or system, it MUST
   include the user or system identifier in the 'sub' claim as defined
   in Section 2.2 of [OAUTH-ACCESSTOKEN-JWT].  These identitifiers MUST
   be used by resource servers protected by the OAuth 2.0 authorization
   service, along with other claims in the access token, to determine if
   access to a resource should be allowed.  The acccess token MAY
   include additional claims to convey contextual, attestation-derived,
   or policy-related information that enables fine-grained access
   control.  The resource server MAY use the access token and the
   information it contains along with other authorization systems (e.g.
   policy based, attribute based or role based authorization systems)
   when enforcing access.  Where JWT access tokens are not used, opaque
   tokens may be issued and validated through introspection mechanisms.
   This framework supports both models and does not require a specific
   token format, provided that equivalent authorization semantics are
   maintained.

   When opaque tokens are used, the resource server MUST obtain
   authorization information through OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection
   [OAUTH-TOKEN-INTROSPECTION].  The introspection response provides the
   active state of the token and associated authorization attributes
   equivalent to those conveyed in structured tokens.

10.3.  Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 Access Token

   Agents MUST obtain OAuth 2.0 accss tokens using standards OAuth 2.0
   Authorization Flows.

10.3.1.  User Delegates Authorization

   When a User grants authorization to an Agent to access one or more
   resources (Tools, LLMs), the Authorization Code Grant MUST be used as
   described in Section 4.1 of [OAUTH-FRAMEWORK].

10.3.2.  Agent Obtains Own Authorization

   Agents obtaining access tokens on their own behalf MUST use the
   Client Credentials Grant as described in Section 4.4 of
   [OAUTH-FRAMEWORK] or the JWT Authorization Grant as described in
   Section 2.1 of [OAUTH-CLIENTAUTH-JWT].  When using the Client
   Credentials Grant, the Agent MUST authenticate itself using one of
   the mechanisms described in Section 9 and MUST NOT use static, long
   lived client secrets to authenticate.

10.3.3.  System Access to Agents

   When Agents are invoked by a System (e.g. a batch job, or another
   Agent), the System SHOULD treat the Agent as an OAuth protected
   resource.  The System SHOULD obtain an access token using the same
   mechanisms defined for an Agent and then present the OAuth access
   token to the Agent.  The Agent should validate the access token,
   including verifiying that the 'aud' claim of the access token
   includes the Agent.  Once validated, the Agent SHOULD use OAuth 2.0
   Token Exchange as defined in [OAUTH-TOKEN-EXCHANGE] to exchange the
   access token it received for a new access token to access.  The Agent
   then uses the newly issued access token to access the protected
   resources (LLM or Tools) it needs to complete the request.

   If a System invokes an Agent and does not treat the Agent as an OAuth
   protected resource, the Agent MUST obtain its own OAuth access token
   as described in Section 10.3.2.

10.3.4.  OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices

   Agents MUST support the Best Current Practice for OAuth 2.0 Security
   as described in [OAUTH-BCP] when requesting acccess tokens.

10.4.  Risk reduction with Transaction Tokens

   Resources servers, whether they are LLMs, Tools or Agents (in the
   Agent-to-Agent case) may be composed of multiple microservices that
   are invoked to complete a request.  The access tokens presented to
   the Agent, LLM or Tools can typically be used with multiple
   transactions and consequently have broader scope than needed to
   complete any specific transaction.  Passing the access token from one
   microservice to another within an Agent, LLM or the Tools invoked by
   the Agent increases the risk of token theft and replay attaccks.  For
   example, an attacker may discover and access token passed between
   microservices in a log file or crash dump, exfiltrate it, and use it
   to invoke a new transaction with different parameters (e.g. increase
   the trnasaction amount, or invoke an unrelated call as part of
   executing a lateral move).

   To avoid passing access tokens between microservices, the Agent, LLM
   or Tools SHOULD exchange the access token it receives for a
   transaction token, as defined in the Transaction Token specification
   as defined in [OAUTH-TRANS-TOKENS].  The transaction token allows for
   identity and auhtorization information to be passed along a call
   chain between microservices.  The transaction token issuer enriches
   the transaction token with context of the caller that presented the
   access token (e.g. IP address etc), transaction context (transaction
   amount), identity information and a unique transaction identifier.
   This results in a dowscoped token that is bound to a specific
   transaction that cannot be used as an access token, with another
   transaction, or within the same transaction with modified transaction
   details (e.g. change in transaction amount).  Transaction tokens are
   typically short lived, further lmiting the risk in case they are
   obtained by an attacker by liomiting the time window during which
   these tokens will be accepted.

   A transaction token MAY be used to obtain an access token to call
   another service (e.g. another Agent, Tool or LLM) by using OAuth 2.0
   Token Exchange as defined in [OAUTH-TOKEN-EXCHANGE].

10.5.  Cross Domain Access

   Agents often require access to resources that are protected by
   different OAuth 2.0 authorization servers.  When the components in
   Figure 1 are protected by different logical authorization servers, an
   Agent SHOULD use OAuth Identity and Authorization Chaining Across
   Domains as defined in ([OAUTH-ID-CHAIN]), or a derived specification
   such as the Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant
   [OAUTH-JWT-ASSERTION], to obtain an access token from the relevant
   authorization servers.

   When using OAuth Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains
   ([OAUTH-ID-CHAIN]), an Agent SHOULD use the access token or
   transaction token it received to obtain a JWT authorization grant as
   described in Section 2.3 of [OAUTH-ID-CHAIN] and then use the JWT
   authorization grant it receives to obtain an access token for the
   resource it is trying to access as defined in Section 2.4 of
   [OAUTH-ID-CHAIN].

   When using the Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant
   [OAUTH-JWT-ASSERTION], the identity assertion (e.g. the OpenID
   Connect ID Token or SAML assertion) for the target end-user is used
   to obtain a JWT assertion as described in Section 4.3 of
   [OAUTH-JWT-ASSERTION], which is then used to obtain an access token
   as described in Section 4.4 of [OAUTH-JWT-ASSERTION].

   OAuth Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains
   ([OAUTH-ID-CHAIN]) provides a general mechanism for obtaining cross-
   domain access that can be used whether an identity assertion like a
   SAML or OpenID Connect token is available or not.  The Identity
   Assertion JWT Authorization Grant [OAUTH-JWT-ASSERTION] is optimised
   for cases where an identity assertion like a SAML or OpenID Connect
   token is available from an identity provider that is trusted by all
   the OAuth authorization servers as it removes the need for the user
   to re-authenticate.  This is typically used within enterprise
   deployments to simplify authorization delegation for multiple
   software-as-a-service offerings.

10.6.  Human in the Loop

   An OAuth authorization server MAY conclude that the level of access
   requested by an Agent requires explicit user confirmation.  In such
   cases the authorization server SHOULD either decline the request or
   obtain additional authorization from the User using the OpenID Client
   Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) protocol.  This triggers
   an out-of-band interaction allowing the user to approve or deny the
   requested operation without exposing credentials to the agent (for
   example a push notification requesting the user to approve a request
   through an authenticator application on their mobile device).

   Interactive agent frameworks may also solicit user confirmation
   directly during task execution (for example tool invocation approval
   or parameter confirmation).  Such interactions do not by themselves
   constitute authorization and MUST be bound to a verifiable
   authorization grant issued by the authorization server.  The agent
   SHOULD therefore translate user confirmation into an OAuth
   authorization event (e.g., step-up authorization via CIBA) before
   accessing protected resources.

   This model aligns with user-solicitation patterns such as those
   described by the Model Context Protocol ([MCP]), where an agent
   pauses execution and requests user confirmation before performing
   sensitive actions.  The final authorization decision remains with the
   authorization server, and the agent MUST NOT treat local UI
   confirmation alone as sufficient authorization.

10.7.  Tool-to-Service Acccess

   Tools expose interfaces to underlying services and resources.  Access
   to the Tools SHOULD be controlled by OAuth which MAY be augmented by
   policy, attribute or role based authorization systems (amongst
   others).  If the Tools are implemented as one or more microservices,
   it should use transaction tokens to reduce risk as described in
   Section 10.4 to avoid passing access tokens around within the Tool
   implementation.

   Access from the Tools to the resources and services MAY be controlled
   through a variety of auhtorization mechanisms, includidng OAuth.  If
   access is controlled through OAuth, the Tools SHOULD use OAuth 2.0
   Token Exchange as defined in [OAUTH-TOKEN-EXCHANGE] to exchange the
   access token it received for a new access token to access the
   resource or service in question.  If the Tool needs access to a
   resource protected by an auhtorization server other than the Tool's
   own authorization server, it SHOULD use the OAuth Identity and
   Authorization Chaining Across Domains ([OAUTH-ID-CHAIN]) to obtain an
   access token from the authroization server protecting the resource it
   needs to access.

   *Note:* It is an anti-pattern for Tools to forward access tokens it
   received from the Agent to Services or Resources.  It increases the
   risk of credential theft and lateral attacks.

10.8.  Privacy Considerations

   Authorization tokens may contain user identifiers, agent identifiers,
   audience restrictions, transaction details, and contextual
   attributes.  Deployments SHOULD minimize disclosure of personally
   identifiable or sensitive information in tokens and prefer audience-
   restricted and short-lived tokens.  Where possible, opaque tokens
   with introspection SHOULD be preferred when claim minimization is
   required.

   Agents SHOULD request only the minimum scopes and authorization
   details necessary to complete a task.  Resource servers SHOULD avoid
   logging full tokens and instead log token identifiers or hashes.
   When authorization context is propagated across services, derived or
   down-scoped tokens (such as transaction tokens) SHOULD be used to
   reduce correlation and replay risk.

   Implementations MUST ensure that user identity information delegated
   to agents is not exposed to unrelated services and that cross-domain
   authorization exchanges only disclose information required for the
   target authorization decision.

10.9.  OAuth 2.0 Discovery in Dynamic Environments

   In dynamic Agent deployments (e.g., ephemeral workloads, multi-tenant
   services, and frequently changing endpoint topology), Agents and
   other participants MAY use OAuth discovery mechanisms to reduce
   static configuration and to bind runtime decisions to verifiable
   metadata.

10.9.1.  Authorization Server Capability Discovery

   An Agent that needs to obtain tokens MAY discover authorization
   server endpoints and capabilities using OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Server Metadata [OAUTH-SERVER-METADATA] and/or OpenID Connect
   Discovery [OpenIDConnect.Discovery].  This allows the Agent to learn
   the as issuer identifier, authorization and token endpoints,
   supported grant types, client authentication methods, signing keys
   (via jwks_uri), and other relevant capabilities without
   preconfiguring them.

10.9.2.  Protected Resource Capability Discovery

   When an Agent is invoking a Tool, the Agent MAY use OAuth 2.0
   Protected Resource Metadata [OAUTH-RESOURCE-METADATA] to discover how
   the resource is protected, including the resource identifier and the
   applicable Authorization Server(s) that protects Tool access.  This
   enables an Agent to select the correct issuer/audience and token
   acquisition flow at runtime, even when resources are deployed or
   moved dynamically.

   A Tool that atttempts to acccess and OAuth protected resource MAY use
   OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata [OAUTH-RESOURCE-METADATA] in a
   similar way as an Agent.  Similarly, a System may use
   [OAUTH-RESOURCE-METADATA] when accessing an Agent.

10.9.3.  Client Capability Discovery

   Other actors (e.g., Authorization Servers, registrars, or policy
   systems) may need to learn about any entities (System, Agent, Tool)
   that acts as OAuth clients.  Where supported, they MAY use Client ID
   Metadata Documents [OAUTH-CLIENT-METADATA], which allow a client to
   host its metadata at a URL-valued client_id so that the relying party
   can retrieve client properties (e.g., redirect URIs, software
   statement, display information, and other registered client metadata)
   without prior bilateral registration.

   As an alternative, entities acting as OAuth clients MAY register
   their capabilities with authroization servers as defined in the OAuth
   2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [OAUTH-REGISTRATION].

11.  Agent Monitoring and Remediation

   Because agents may perform sensitive actions autonomously or on
   behalf of users, deployments MUST maintain sufficient observability
   to reconstruct agent behavior and authorization context after
   execution.  Monitoring is therefore a security control, not solely an
   operational feature.

   Any particiapant in the system, including the Agent, Tool, System,
   LLM or other resources and service MAY subscribe to change
   notifications using eventing mechanisms such as the OpenID Shared
   Signals Framework [SSF] with the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile
   [CAEP] to receive security and authorization-relevant signals.  Upon
   receipt of a relevant signal (e.g., session revoked, subject
   disabled, token replay suspected, risk elevated), the recipient
   SHOULD remediate by attenuating access, such as terminating local
   sessions, discarding cached tokens, re-acquiring tokens with updated
   constraints, reducing privileges, or re-running policy evaluation
   before continueing to allow acccess.  Recipients of such signals MUST
   ensure that revoked or downgraded authorization is enforced without
   undue delay.  Cached authorization decisions and tokens that are no
   longer valid MUST NOT continue to be used after a revocation or risk
   notification is received.

   To support detection, investigation, and accountability, deployments
   MUST produce durable audit logs covering authorization decisions and
   subsequent remediations.  Audit records MUST be tamper-evident and
   retained according to the security policy of the deployment.

   At a minimum, audit events MUST record:

   *  authenticated agent identifier

   *  delegated subject (user or system), when present

   *  resource or tool being accessed

   *  action requested and authorization decision

   *  timestamp and transaction or request correlation identifier

   *  attestation or risk state influencing the decision

   *  remediation or revocation events and their cause

   Monitoring systems SHOULD correlate events across Agents, Tools,
   Services, Resources and LLMs to detect misuse patterns such as
   replay, confused deputy behavior, privilege escalation, or unexpected
   action sequences.

   End-to-end audit is enabled when Agents, Users, Systems, LLMs, Tools,
   services and resources have stable, verifiable identifiers that allow
   auditors to trace "which entity did what, using which authorization
   context, and why access changed over time."

   Implementations SHOULD provide operators the ability to reconstruct a
   complete execution chain of an agent task, including delegated
   authority, intermediate calls, and resulting actions across service
   boundaries.

12.  Agent Authentication and Authorization Policy

   The configuration and runtime parameters for Agent Identifiers
   Section 5, Agent Credentials Section 6, Agent Attestation Section 7,
   Agent Credential Provisioning Section 8, Agent Authentication
   Section 9, Agent Authorization Section 10 and Agent Monitoring and
   Remediation Section 11 collectively constitute the authentication and
   authorization policy within which the Agent operates.

   Because these parameters are highly deployment- and risk-model-
   specific (and often reflect local governance, regulatory, and
   operational constraints), the policy model and document format are
   out of scope for this framework and are not recommended as a target
   for standardization within this specification.  Implementations MAY
   represent policy in any suitable “policy-as-code” or configuration
   format (e.g., JSON/YAML), provided it is versioned, reviewable, and
   supports consistent evaluation across the components participating in
   the end-to-end flow.

13.  Agent Compliance

   Compliance for Agent-based systems SHOULD be assessed by auditing
   observed behavior and recorded evidence (logs, signals, and
   authorization decisions) against the deployment’s Agent
   Authentication and Authorization Policy Section 12.  Since compliance
   criteria are specific to individual deployments, organizations,
   industries and jurisdictions, they are out of scope for this
   framework though implementers SHOULD ensure strong observability and
   accountable governance, subject to their specific business needs.
